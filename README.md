#MVC with PHP Symfony
This repository contains an implementation of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern using PHP Symfony. The purpose of this implementation is to provide a structured way to build web applications that separates the application logic from the user interface, making the code easier to maintain and scale.

##Getting Started
To get started with this project, you'll need to have PHP and Symfony installed on your computer. If you don't have these installed already, you can follow the installation instructions on the official Symfony website.

Once you have Symfony installed, you can clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

`git clone https://github.com/your-username/mvc.git`
After cloning the repository, navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies by running the following command:

`composer install`

##Usage
This project includes a sample application that demonstrates the use of the MVC design pattern in Symfony. To run the application, navigate to the project directory and execute the following command:

`symfony server:start`

This command will start the Symfony web server and you can access the sample application by navigating to http://localhost:8000 in your web browser.
